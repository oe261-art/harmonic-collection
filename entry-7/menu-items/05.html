<div class="description">
<p>Exactly as the name suggests, this dish is small pieces of fish (usually a flaky white fish like cod, flounder, or sole) that's lightly battered, deep fried to a light golden color, and served with salt and pepper. The result is a plate loaded with light, crisp, and slightly doughy goodness.</p>

<p>I've had this type of fish so many times I lost count. It's usually served during the first course of a meal at those banquet-style restaurants. To be honest, this was never my favorite dish at these types of dinners... or at all, really. I always thought the fish was  too salty, there was never enough pepper to balance it out, and the batter was almost always too doughy. My older brother really likes it though. He's always been a fan of salty foods. </p>
