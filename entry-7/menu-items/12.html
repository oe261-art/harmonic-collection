<p>Exactly as the name suggests, this dish is the perfect combination of sourness and sweetness in a savoury dish. This way of cooking porkchops stands out not just for the flavours, but also for its striking red color.</p>

<p>This was always my favorite dish at those banquet-style restaurants. I remember my brothers and I bikering over who'd get the last pieces. Nowadays, I offer it to my little cousins. They get "cute baby cousin rights". Both sides of my family go to these types of restaurants for special occasions like birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. Actually, a lot of my best childhood memories happeneded during these types of dinners. </p>
