<p>The steamed chicken is on the simpler side, but the ginger scallion sauce gives the chicken so much flavor! The recipe itself is easy make recreate, taking a little over an hour to make; and will provide a yummy dinner for a mid-to-large family.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but I've been gravitating towards this style of chicken lately. It's something my family's been ordering in restaurants for a while, but I never grabbed for it until the past two-ish years. I think it has something to do with being bullied at school for the type of food I ate. Kids in my hometown aren't used to traditional homestyle Chinese meals, which I get. There aren't a lot of Chinese places other than Panda Express or Chopstick Express in neighboring towns.</p>
