<p>Now this is a dish I absolutely can not stand. I'm sorry, I know a lot of people like it, but I just can't get into it. My older brother really likes it though, so Mah-Mah brings it in whenever she stays over. The only reason why I included this dish is because of my older brother, so this one's for him. Love you, Gaw-Gaw. <3 </p>
