<p>Whole chicken braised in a soy sauce flavoured broth, providing a strong aromatic taste and an appetizing colour on the skin. The meat is fall-apart tender, flavourful, appetizing & comforting. Soy sauce chicken is a classic dish that can be easily made and served at home. </p>

<p>This is another easy recipe my mom taught me. Personally, I prefer this style of chicken more than char siu chicken mostly because it's less sweet and has less of a charred flavor. I just feel like it's more versatile, and I could share it with my non-Chinese friends at school. I mentioned this earlier, but I was bullied a lot by most of my graduating class for bringing in homecooked Chinese foods for lunch. This is other reasons caused me to be embarassed of my cultural background for most of my childhood. Funnily enough, a good chunk of those kids were also Chinese or some other kind of Asian. Looking back at it now, I realized that a lot of the Asian kids in my hometown are very Americanized, and don't really care to know or learn about Chinese-style cooking; which it totally fine; maybe they were insecure about it growing up too. It just sucks 'cause they are really missing out. </p>
