<div class="description">
<p>A Chinese staple featuring dumplings with delicate skin in a clear, savory broth. The wonton skin is so thin that they melt in your mouth. The filling is a delicious and savoury, and the broth is light and aromatic. This dish is a staple for a reason; I don't know a single person who doesn't enjoy this soup.</p>

<p>I grew up eating this dish. It's another one of my childhood favorites, especially my Mah-Mah's wontons. Some of my most prominent memories are of Mah-Mah sitting at the kitchen island, hunched over a big bowl of wonton filling, Shanghai-style wonton wrappers (Twin Marquis brand, I believe), a small bowl of eggs with a spoon, and two baking trays. Sometimes I'd help her, pulling up a stool, hunching over into a shrimp posture, and we work in silence. We occasionally crack jokes in broken English and Chinese. We have a hard time communicating most of the time. I don't understand Chinese, she doesn't understand English, but we try. The repetiveness of the task was mind-numbing; relaxing. Take a wrapper, put a small ball of filling in the center, brush a bit of egg around the edges of the wrapper, fold-n'-pinch it closed, place it on the baking tray. These moments were probably my most peaceful; times when I felt most connected with myself and Mah-Mah. </p>
