<div class="description">
<p>A delicious and easy meal that utilizes leftover rice from the night prior. You can add anything to it; eggs, beef, shrimp, vegetables, anything. It's usually cooked with soy sauce; and aromatics like garlic, ginger, and green onions. Sesame oil, oyster sauce, and other seasonings like salt, pepper, and sugar are also used to enhance the flavor.</p>

<p>This is a dish I actually used to hate, which is werid 'cause I love it now. It reminds me of coming home from school after Yearbook Club, or GSA, or Japanese Culture club; tired out of my ass, cold from the winter chill. Making it myself reminds me of trudging my feet inside the house to working heat, the sound of the stove vent, Mom scraping the ladle against the wok, and the smell of eggs and rice (and maybe kimchi; she was experimenting with it at the time). </p>
