<p>A nutrious and light Chinese soup. The coconut water makes the soup refreshing, sligthtly toasted and sweet. The chicken helps creates balance through savoury flavors. Soul-warming and not too heavy, this soup is perfect for any season of the year.</p>

<div class="story">
<p>The first time I had this soup was around ten years ago. I was about eight years old, and I was going through a "I love coconut flavored things" phase. I think my Mah-Mah picked up on this, and started making coconut chicken soup ever since. Now, I don't love coconut stuff as much as I used to, but this is still my favorite soup. Mah-Mah frequently makes it for me to save in my dorm. I should ask her for her recipe so I can make it myself, but it probably won't taste or feel as good. Maybe I can make it with her next time. Y'know, "learn from experience".</p>
