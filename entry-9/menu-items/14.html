<div class="description">
<p>Crispy pork belly is a popular dish in which the meat is tender and the skin is rendered into a light, airy, and perfect crunch. The key to its signature crispiness is the preparation process, drying the skin and using a two-stage cooking process.</p>

<p>This had got to be my favorite item on this menu. My Mah-Mah would make this a lot growing up. Actually, my older brother and I would fight over who got more (it was me, I'm Mah-Mah's favorite, hehe). Unfortunately, she doesn't make this as much anymore. The rare occasion she does make it, I'm not home to hoard it on my plate. Kind of morbid, but she does make it everytime my family goes to the cemetery to pay respects to my great-grandma (my Bak-Bak) and great-grandpa (my Bak-Gung).  </p>
