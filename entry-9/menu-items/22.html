<p>I don't think my mom or Mah-Mah ever cooked this at home. The only times I had lo mein were in the form of long life noodles for birthdays. I think the last birthday I had them was during my maternal grandpa's (my Gung-Gung) 70-something birthday. He's gone know, but that's one of my last stand out memories of him.</p>
