<p>Char siu chicken is like if sweet, savory, and tender were in a trouple and had a baby. It's barbecued chicken dish inspired by traditional Cantonese char siu pork, typically made with boneless chicken thighs because we don't got time to de-bone that shit. For maximum flavor and juiciness, it's marinated in a blend of Chinese sauces and spices, then roasted, in the oven for a caramelized, glistening glaze.</p>

<p>This is one of those easy, "one-two step" recipes my mom taught me. Actually, this recipe is so easy, my older brother can do it (we can't cook)! Granted, the way Mom does it is just by taking your chicken thighs, tossing them in a gallon Ziploc bag with pre-made char siu sauce from the Asian food mart, and leaving it in the fridge overnight until you're ready to bake it. Mother Goose ain't got time to mix a bunch of separate spices and sauces, she got kids to feed. </p>
