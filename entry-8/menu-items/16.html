<div class="description">
<p>A dish that consists of thinly sliced beef, fermented black beans, garlic, ginger; cooked with soy sauce and oyster sauce. Often stir-fried with vegetables like onions and bell peppers, this is a great dish for a family-style meal.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I haven't had this dish in a long while. The last time I remeber having it was when my family took my grandpa (my Yeh-Yeh) and his "caretaker" out for lunch. I sensed a weird awkwardness, but I didn't really question it at the time. I figured it was probably because my Yeh-Yeh and dad were just stoic guys toward each other, but my mom was also kind of awkward the whole time too. Turns out the reason why it was so awkward was because Yeh-Yeh's "caretaker" wasn't just his caretaker, but his romantic partner of many, many, many years... And that's how my siblings and I found out he had an affair many years ago.  </p>
