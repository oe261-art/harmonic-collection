<div class="description">
<p>A popular Chinese-American dish featuring deep-fried chunks of chicken coated in a glossy, sticky, and mildly spicy sauce. Known for balancing sweet, savory, and tangy flavors, with a slight kick of heat; it is a staple of Chinese takeout menus across the United States. Funnily enough, this dish is largely unknown in mainland China.</p>

<p> I had never heard of General Tso chicken until a friend asked me about in 2023. Deadass, no clue what they were talking about. I forgot how we got onto the topic, but we were talking about different meats and stuff we ate for Thanksgiving, and I mentioned how one time, my family was hosting and thought it'd be a good idea to make roast beef, ham, turkey, duck, and chicken; to which my friend said something along the lines of "oh, like General Tso chicken?" When I tell you a gave them a blank stare, I was literally looking at them like (O_O), 'cause I didn't know what they were talking about. My mom never made it, neither of my grandmas made it, I had never seen it on any Chinatown menu; I was confuzzled. My friend had to explain what it was to me, and I eventually tried it with my older brother on a later date. It tasted kind of... off(?) to me, but my older brother liked it , so that's good, I guess (granted, he likes anything fried and with sauce on it). </p>
