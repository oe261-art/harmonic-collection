<div class="description">
<p>This Chinese stir fry highlights tender beef enveloped in spicy sauce made from layers of chiles, garlic, ginger and a butt-ton of Szechuan peppercorns. And of course, there is a touch of sweetness as to not make the spice too overpowering.</p>

<div class="story">
<p>As much as I like this dish, I don't get to have this style of beef often. While my dad and I enjoy spicy foods, my mom and siblings don't. Since majority rules, we don't order this much whenever we go out to eat as a family. To be honest, my spice tolerance isn't that high either, I like when I can get a little kick and still taste the different flavor profiles of the food. My dad is a different case though, he likes booty-hole burn levels of spicy. Don't know what's wrong with him. </p>
