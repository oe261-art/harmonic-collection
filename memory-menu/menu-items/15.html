<p>This is another recipe my mom taught me. It's one she learned when she was a kid from her mom. My mom's a middle child of five siblings. Both parents were working, her older sisters had they're own work or family to take care of, so she had to take care of her younger siblings most of the time. This included cooking dinner whenever her parents were working late. My mom described this dish as a "poor person dish" because it was quick and cheap, but she still makes it even though we're pretty well off now.  </p>
