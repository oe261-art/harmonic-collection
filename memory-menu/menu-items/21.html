<div class="description">
<p>A popular Chinese dish of stir-fried or pan-fried noodles with vegetables and often meat or tofu. The noodles are fried to achieve a desirable crispy or semi-crispy texture, which are amazing with a simple gravy.</p>

<div class="story">
<p>This is a dish I always liked but grew to like even more. It's probably the only fried food my dad is okay with my family and I eating (he's been really into eating healthy). The only thing I never liked about this dish the mushrooms Mah-Mah would add in the gravy; I'd always pick them out... and still do.</p>
