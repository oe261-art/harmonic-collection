<div class="description">
<p>Cantonese-style roasted pork that is sweet, savory, and juicy. Traditionally made by skewering long strips of seasoned boneless pork with forks and cooking them over an open fire or in a rotisserie oven. The name chā sīu literally translates to "fork roasted".</p>

<p>This is another one of those easy, "one-two step" recipes my mom taught me. It's basically the exact same process as char siu chicken, but with pork. I will say though, I think this recipe is more versatile. You can have char siu pork over rice with a fried egg, in a banh mi-like sandwich, in instant noodles to add some protein, alone (like you, single ah-); it's great, good shit! </p>
