<p>A popular Chinese dish you’ll find at any restaurant, it's incredibly simple with a few ingredients. The tenderness of the fish is enhanced through steaming it, of course with ginger and scallion, and served with soy sauce over it. It’s much healthier than frying the fish and makes for a family-style meal at home.</p>

<p>This is how Mah-Mah usually made fish. I swear she makes this dish at least once or twice a month. When I was little, she would always offer me the cheek meat of the fish (the smallest and softest part) while she got the fish's eyes. I was always grossed out by the idea of eating the eyeballs, but it's apparently good for you? I don't know, maybe I'll try it at some point. </p>
