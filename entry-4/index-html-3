<div class="description">
<p>This soup features eggs, corn, and chicken broth. Depending on your preferences, you can add seasonings like soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil, ginger and scallions. The soup has a slightly thick consistency, making it a bit more filling (that could just be me though).</p>

<div class="story">
<p>The first time I had this soup was with my mom and older brother in the same dim-sum spot as the last story. My mom let me older a dish I liked, so my older brother got to choose the soup as a compromise. I remember thinking the soup looked really yellow when it came out, like, unaturally yellow. Regardless, the soup was still good, and my brother and I gobbled it up like starved Victorian children. It wasn't until we finished that our mom told us the cooks probably added yellow food coloring to exaggerate the yellowness.</p>
