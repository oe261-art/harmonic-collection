<p>Just as the name suggests, this soup is the perfect lovechild of sour and spice. It can range in flavor since you can control the heat and sourness levels yourself. If you're like my older brother, you can toss a shit-ton of vinegar in it. If youâ€™re like me, you can add some more white pepper.

<p>My mom got me onto this soup a while ago. We were in our usual dim-sum spot in a neighboring town (since ours didn't have any Chinese spots at the time... and still doesn't). I'm pretty sure it was the two of us and my older brother, and my mom said to us "you guys should have some soup, it's cold out," and so she ordered us the soup. I ended up liking it a lot, but my older brother didn't ('cause he's a spice wimp). My mom ended up drinking two bowls of soup.</p>
